# Supermarket Project

This Python project simulates a supermarket environment, modeling information about employees and products. The main_script.py file loads data from CSV files, creates instances of the Supermarket, Employee, and Product classes, and performs various operations such as counting employees, identifying the most expensive product, calculating average prices, counting products per category, and finding the oldest employee.

## Project Files

- `supermarket.py`: Contains the classes "Supermarket", "Employee" and "Product" with their respective functionalities.

- `main_script.py`: Demonstrates the usage of the classes by loading data from CSV files and performing operations on a supermarket instance.

- `products.csv`: Contains information about products in the supermarket.

- `employees.csv`: Contains information about employees working in the supermarket.

### How to Run

- Install the required Python library "pandas"
- Place the `supermarket.py` script in the same directory as `main_script.py`.
- Run `main_script.py` to observe the functionalities in action.
