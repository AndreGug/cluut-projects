# Hotel Comparison

This project showcases my implementation of a Python task focused on working with complex data types.

## Tasks

1. **Differences between Lists:**

   - Calculate the symmetric difference between two lists to identify elements present in one list but not in both.

2. **Commonalities between Lists:**

   - Find common values between two lists.

3. **Hotel Marrios vs Hotel Hilten:**

   - Define information about hotels Marrios and Hilten using Python dictionaries.
   - Calculate and compare costs for a 5-day stay at both hotels.
   - Request common available rooms in both hotels.
   - Analyze payment options in both hotels.

4. **Bonus Task:**

   - Determine in which hotel the employee Fernando works and make a decision on where to stay.

### How to run

- The Python code is located in the file `hotel_comparison.py`.
- Execute the file with a Python interpreter to see the results.
